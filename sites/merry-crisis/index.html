  <p class="tilt-shaking">In Scandinavian countries, the Yule goat figures into the Christmas decor of many homes.<br>
    In Norse mythology, the two goats pulled Thor's flying chariot the same way reindeer do Santa's sleigh.<br> On top
    of that, there's also a festive tale that focuses on an invisible Yule goat that checks in on holiday prep before
    the big day.<br> That's why, in 1966, the GÃ¤vle Goat was created to draw shoppers to the Swedish city where it
    resides.<br> Standing 42.6 feet high and seven meters in length, it also weighs a whopping 3.6 tons.</p>
