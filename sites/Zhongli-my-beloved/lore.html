Zhongli, also known as Morax, is a central character in the lore of Genshin Impact. He is one of the Seven, the powerful Archons who govern the different regions of Teyvat, representing the Geo element. Morax, originally a dragon deity, took on a human form to become the ruler of Liyue and establish the contract with its people. Over centuries, he observed the rise and fall of civilizations, ultimately deciding to relinquish his gnosis and step down as an Archon. This act led to significant changes in Liyue's governance and set in motion various events in the game's storyline, making Zhongli's lore a key element in Genshin Impact's narrative.</P>
