          <p>Zhongli's current life in Genshin Impact sees him residing in Liyue Harbor, no longer holding the title of the Geo Archon after relinquishing his Gnosis. He has become a consultant for the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, specializing in archaeology and history. Zhongli enjoys his newfound freedom and spends his time studying ancient relics and the history of Teyvat, often engaging in philosophical discussions. His stoic and contemplative nature remains a core part of his character, and he occasionally assists the Traveler and other characters in their quests and adventures across the land of Teyvat. Please note that the game's storyline may have evolved since my last update, so I recommend checking the latest in-game content or community resources for the most up-to-date information on Zhongli's character and story developments.</p>
